It comes with its own events system\nwhich allows React to bring a consistent event system to browsers that don’t have\n<code>EventTarget</code> (looking at you, IE8).</p>\n<p>The <code>render</code> method returns objects corresponding to the internal representation\nof the virtual DOM.</p>\n<p>React classes are defined by their <code>state</code>.\nWhen creating a class, you specify a <code>getInitialState</code> method which\nwill return the initial state.</p>\n<p>After that, the only way to modify the state is to pass the values\nof the state which have changed to <code>this.setState</code> so that it can update\nthe DOM.</p>\n<p>A React class takes properties when it’s instanciated: they’re called <code>props</code>.\nThey shouldn’t be confused with the <code>state</code>, their content should only be manipulated\nfrom <em>outside</em> the class (even though it can still get default values by\nspecifying a <code>getDefaultProps</code> method which will return them).</p>\n<p>The <code>state</code>, however, should only be modified by the class’ own methods.</p>\n<p>The main advantage to this is that you’re always sure, thanks to the systematic\ncall to <code>render</code>, that your React component will have the expected representation.</p>\n<p>Another advantage to React is its in-house diff algorithm.\nThe virtual DOM gets diffed against the previous one (which is the one you actually see),\nand React works out the smallest amount of operations needed in order to update the\nDOM.</p>\n<p>This solves a few issues like keeping track of the caret’s position in a text\nfield that uses two-way data-binding: since the algorithm doesn’t see any reason\nto update it, the text field doesn’t get re-rendered and you keep the focus.\nIn the same way, if you’ve got a gif looping somewhere in your page, it will keep\nplaying as it normally would.</p>\n<p>React plays very well with JSX, a superset of JS which\nallows you to write your templates with an XML syntax (see example below),\nallowing beginners to get stuff done with it quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"let-s-create-a-react-component\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\"
